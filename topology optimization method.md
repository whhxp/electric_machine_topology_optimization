# Definition of Topology
In design process, the topology usually is considered as a sub-field of geometry. The first work that related to topology was KÃ¶nigsberg bridge problem proposed by Euler. This problem was entitled "The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position", which indicated that the distance was not relevant.[1] Etymologically, the word is derived from the Greek noun *topos* which means location, place, space or domain.[1] In mathematics, topology is concerned with a object that can be deformed, twisted, or stretched in an arbitrary manner.[2] If two objects have the same topology properties, they are said to be homeomorphic. 


# Topology optimization method

Optimize a topology, i.e. to arrange materials or position structures properly and make the objective reaches its global optimal. Traditionally, it can be divided into mainly two approaches, micro-structure topology optimization and marco-structure optimization. [3]


## *Microstructure* 
In microstructure approaches, a fixed finite element mesh is used to describe the design domain. Typically the mesh is uniformly and rectangularly distributed in space, and 
## *Marcostructure* 

In this class, solid isotropic materials are considered as opposed to porous, microstructured ones, and as the topology optimization is performed in conjunction with a shape optimization, the finite element mesh cannot be a fixed one, but must change with the changes of the boundaries of the design. Within the Macrostructure-approach, the topology of a solid body can be changed by growing or degenerating material or by inserting holes. The first method recognizes that an optimal design is simply a subset of the admissible design domain and that it can be obtained by appropriately adding or removing material from the admissible design domain, see 4,132,133,363. 

The second method mentioned consists of an iterative positioning of new holes "bubbles" at specific points in the topology domain. In each iteration, the holes and the existing variable boundaries of the continuous body are simultaneously subjected to a shape optimization procedure see 138,209,210,211,230,298.
